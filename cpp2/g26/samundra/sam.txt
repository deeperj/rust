Class Diagram Report: 

The Above Class diagram is of thedifferent shapes of the area and the class 
such as Triangle,Square, Circle andRectangle. Each of theclass represent the ownsub class where 
as the mainclass is shape and the math which showthe all relationshipbetween them. Similarly the 
Circle class which is called as sub class of the class diagram. It includes the radius with thefunction 
double.Everyclass has their own methods like wise the circleclass has also it’s ownmethods which 
has +Circle()r :double and +Area():double. As we all know that + signmeans that which is public to 
the users. Whereas the– sign means private that which is hidden to the users. Like wise to allthe 
classes I had used sameprocess as thecircle one which is similar to all. 

Programming Code : 

Main.cpp 

#include <iostream> 
#include "shapes.h" 

int main() { 
Shape s; 
s.area(); 
} 

Shapes.cpp 

#include "shapes.h" 

double Shape::area(){ 
cout << "Select a shape " << endl; 


cout << "1. Circle " << endl; 
cout << "2. Triangle " << endl; 
cout << "3. Rectangle " << endl; 
cout << "4. Square " << endl; 

int choice; 
cin >> choice; 
enum shape {circle=1,triangle=2,rectangle=3,square=4}; 
switch(choice){ 
case circle:{ 
cout << "what is the radius? "; 
double r; 
cin >> r; 
Circle c(r); 
cout << "the area is " << c.area(); 
break; 
} 
case rectangle:{ 
cout << "what is the length?"; 
double l; 
cin >> l; 
cout << "what is the breadth?"; 
double b; 
cin >> b; 
Rectangle c(l,b); 
cout <<"the area is " << c.area(); 
break; 
} 
case square:{

cout << "the area is " << c.area(); 
break; 
} 
case triangle:{ 
cout <<" what is the length?";

cin >> l; 
cout <<"what is the base?"; 
double b; 
cin >> b; 
Triangle c(l,b); 
cout <<"the area is " << c.area(); 
break; 
} 
default: 


cout << "invalid selection"; 
exit(0); 
break; 
} 
return 0;

Report for programming code: 

At the beginning we have to create a three cpp files which is Main.cpp, 
Shapes.cpp and Shapes.h. As the question ask me to show the output of the all 
shapes and their area respectively. I have used the different data types on 
this programming such as Double,int, which are very necessary to run the 
programme. As we created the different file called main.cpp, shapes.h, 
shapes.cpp which declared the programme file respectively main.cpp declared 
the main function of the programme which made the programme run correctly 
without any errors. Like wise the shapes.cpp declared the method of the 
programming which includes all the data types and function to the programme 
which allows the compilers to process or run the programme correctly. To run 
the programme we also need to return the value of the each input value or the 
function . Also Shapes.h file declared the input of the programming which is 
different class Circle, Triangle, Rectangle and Square which includes the 
various data types such as double, private and public. 

According there four shapes of area which Circle, Square, Triangle and 
Rectangle. Firstly I have written the coding of circle and shown the output 
which is radius of circle by using the formula math.PI*math.sqr(radius); which 
gives us the area or radius of Circle. Like wise I have written the coding of 
Square and the output which area of Square by using the formula 
math.sqr(side); which gives us the area of square on the Screen. Similarly I 
have written the coding of Rectangle and shown the output which is area of 
rectangle by using the formula (length*breadth) which gives us the area of 
rectangle by entering the any value on the output screen. And finally I have 
also written the coding of the Triangle and the shown the perfect result to 
the users to find the area of the triangle by using the formula 
0.10*(Height*base); which gives the area of triangle to the users by entering 
the any value on the output screen.
