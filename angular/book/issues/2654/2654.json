    "Description": "Following, I think, the instructions in the readme.html of the March 2012 download, I get an authorization exception on the following query. I am unfamiliar with ADM security model. ADM_USER_ID is clearly indicated as the user's email; ADM_ACCOUNT_ID is less clear. Is it the \"Customer ID\", or the \"Primary Account Key\". Instructions could be clearer. Probably self-explanatory for most seasoned ADM users, but not obvious to others what to do to get the sample working.\n \n    query {\n        for n in travelInfo.BritishEmbassiesAndHighCommissions do \n        select n\n        take 2\n    }|> Seq.iter (fun n -> printfn \"%s\\n\" n.Address)\n \nusing \"Customer ID\":\n  InnerException: System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceClientException\n       HResult=-2146233079\n       Message=The authorization type you provided is not supported.  Only Basic and OAuth are supported\n \nusing \"Primary Account Key\":\n<h2>403 - Forbidden: Access is denied.</h2>\n  <h3>You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied.</h3>",
