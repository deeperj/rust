    "Description": "I've downloaded the latest source, opened the solution in VS2013, I got the errors in the attached log file. The one that I don't know what to do about is that there is a file called ..\\Shared\\SerDes.fs that does not appear to be checked in to source control so I can't compile the Hadoop samples.\n\nThere were two other missing files ProvidedTypes-head__d__.fs and ProvidedTypes-head__d__.fsi, but it looks like those files may have just been renamed to ProvidedTypes-head.fs and ProvidedTypes-head.fsi",
