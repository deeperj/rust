Instead, they use a more user-friendly programming language to code<br>the software and they invoke system tools to translate their programs into<br>the machine code of the computer.<br>The usual tool which performs this translation is a <em>compiler</em>,<br>which typically works in concert with a <em>linker</em> and a <em>loader</em><br>to put the machine code into the computer's memory.<br>(Sometimes an <em>interpreter</em> may be used to achieve a similar effect.)</p><br><br><p><br>But what kind of style should a computer program have?  Should it resemble<br>the machine code of the computer? We could, for example, use a programming<br>language which lets us write the line<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;<span>counter = counter &#43; 1;</span>&lt;/tt&gt;<br><br>The correspondence between this line of code and the example ARM instruction<br>given above should be evident.<br>Indeed, some of the older programming languages such as FORTRAN were<br>designed with statements deliberately similar in nature to the commands<br>which control the computer processor.<br>These languages have a style which is known as <em>imperative</em> because<br>programs can be read as sequences of commands which the computer must obey.<br>The Basic and C languages would be other examples of imperative languages.</p><br><br><p><br>However, there is no reason why a programming language should be designed<br>around the concept of a command.<br>The only requirements are that the notation provided by the programming language<br>must allow us to specify the software in a convenient manner and it must be<br>possible to build a compiler (or an interpreter) for executing the software<br>on a computer.</p><br><br><p><br>There are several alternatives to the imperative style for a programming<br>language.  They include <em>object-oriented programming</em>,<br><em>logic programming</em>, and <em>functional programming</em>.<br>The term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigms">programming paradigm</a><br>is often used to describe the style of a programming language.<br>Some programming languages closely adhere to a particular programming<br>paradigm: for example Smalltalk is almost purely object-oriented and<br>Haskell is almost purely functional.<br>Other languages, for pragmatic reasons, straddle two or more camps<br>and support features from more than one paradigm.<br>For example, Java and C&#43;&#43; provide features from both the object oriented<br>and the imperative paradigms.<br>C# is similar to Java but some features from the functional paradigm have<br>also been added to the newest versions of the language.<br>F# is a language where the functional paradigm dominates, but where<br>the imperative and the object-oriented paradigms also play strong roles.</p><br><br><p><br>So, what is this functional programming paradigm? The following sections<br>should provide a brief introduction to the main ideas.</p><br><br><br><h2>The Basis of Functional Programming</h2><br><br><p><br>Every (useful) computer program takes input in some form and produces output<br>in some form.<br>That input may be generated by keystrokes on the keyboard, from data bytes<br>in a disk file, by a stylus on a touch sensitive screen, or in many other<br>ways.  However, when the input reaches the program, it has been converted<br>to bit patterns (and these are equivalent to numbers).<br>The program's output may take the form of characters or images drawn on<br>a screen, data bytes written to a file, sounds emitted by a speaker, or<br>many other forms again.  However, the program itself generates only bit<br>patterns to produce all these different kinds of output.</p><br><br><p><br>In its simplest form, a computer program inputs numbers and produces<br>numbers as its result.<br>With this viewpoint, a program is very similar in nature to<br>a mathematical function.<br>For example, the line of mathematics<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let h = sin(&pi;/4)<br><br>could be viewed as a request to evaluate the sine function with<br>&pi;/4 as its input and to use the name <em>h</em><br>for the output, i.e. the function result.</p><br><br><p><br>A useful programming language needs more than the ability to<br>invoke predefined functions like the <em>sine</em> function.<br>It particularly needs the ability to define new functions.<br>Mathematics provides some notations for that too.<br>The notations can be recursive too.<br>For example, the familiar factorial function could be defined<br>like this:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Images/factorialDef.png" alt=""><br><br><br>In a typical functional programming language, that function<br>definition might be programmed like this:</p><br><pre><br>    let factorial n =<br>        if n = 0 then 1<br>        else factorial (n - 1) * n<br></pre>
<br>
<p><br>(This definition is almost in, but not quite, F# notation.)</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>The main characteristics of a &lsquo;pure&rsquo; functional programming<br>language are:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<br>
<li> the program consists of a sequence of function definitions,
<br>
</li><li> functions can contain local definitions of other functions (i.e. they can be nested),
<br>
</li><li> functions cannot have side-effects (e.g. if the name <em>h</em> has been associated<br>with some value, then invoking a function cannot cause <em>h</em> to suddenly<br>be associated with a different value).
<br>
</li></ul>
<br>
<p><br>These characteristics are consistent with mathematical conventions.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>One of the earliest researchers who worked on the idea of using mathematical functions<br>to describe computations was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>.<br>He developed a notation known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>,<br>and that notation became the basis for the first functional programming language to go into widespread<br>use -- Lisp 1.5.<br>One of Church's contributions was to provide a notation for defining a function without giving<br>it a name (the so-called <em>anonymous function</em>).<br>Although it sounds trivial, the notation is so useful that it has been incorporated into major<br>languages such as Python and C# (as well as in all the functional languages in common use).<br>A second major contribution was to consider functions to be <em>first-class values</em>.<br>What that means in practice is that a function can be passed as an argument to another function,<br>and that it is also possible for a function to create a new function on the fly and return<br>that as a result.<br>Again, all the functional languages in common use do treat functions as being first-class values.<br>Functions which accept other functions as argument are known as <em>higher-order functions</em>.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Why Functional Programming Is Important</h2>
<br><br>
<p><br>The original functional programming language, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">LISP 1.5</a>,<br>was widely used for artificial intelligence (AI) applications because of its suitability for<br>symbolic processing.<br>The name LISP is short for &ldquo;LISt Processing&rdquo;, indicating that lists are<br>used as the main data structure in LISP programming.<br>Lisp and its descendant languages (which include Scheme and Common Lisp) are<br>still important in the AI community.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>The functional programming paradigm has, however, many followers outside the AI community.<br>A functional programming language is taught as the first programming language at many<br>universities and colleges.  Why do they do that?<br>And software written in functional languages is becoming ever important in industry.<br>Again, why?<br>Some of the answers to these questions are listed below.</p>

<p><br>While many educators want to teach a programming language, such as C&#43;&#43; or Java, which<br>is immediately useful as a job skill, other educators have a different focus.<br>They want their students to first learn how to design an algorithm, how to reason<br>about their software, and above all to understand the concepts clearly.<br>An imperative programming language like C (or an object-oriented language with<br>imperative features like Java, C# or C&#43;&#43;) presents many difficulties to beginners<br>because of unexpected side-effects in their code and difficulties dealing with<br>pointers or references.  Too often, a beginner goes into a edit-run-debug cycle<br>that leads to an (apparently) working program without ever really understanding<br>what their code is doing.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>A functional programming language forces the programmer to break up a<br>problem into smaller functions.<br>It forces the programmer to know what each function is supposed to do.<br>Each function can be individually tested. <br>There is an entire discipline of program development which is<br>sadly lacking in the imperative paradigm (and is too often<br>absent in the object-oriented paradigm).</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>It is the experience of the universities and colleges which teach<br>functional programming first that their students have no trouble<br>learning languages like C or Java afterwards.<br>On the other hand, students whose first language is C or Java<br>appear to have difficulty adapting to a functional language<br>and may never become comfortable with recursion.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Use in Industry</h3>
<br><br>
<p><br>Many commercial applications have been developed in functional<br>programming languages.<br>A partial list appears in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#Use_in_industry">the Wikipedia<br>page on functional programming</a>.<br>The reasons for choosing a functional language include:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<br>
<li>reliability (functional programs tend to contain fewer bugs),
<br>
</li><li>coding productivity (functional programs tend to be shorter than their<br>equivalents in other languages),
<br>
</li><li>efficiency on multiprocessor systems.
<br>
</li></ul>
<br><br>
<p><br>The last point needs some further elaboration.<br>In a typical programming language such as C/C&#43;&#43;, C# or Java, a function or method<br>call of this form</p>
<br>
<pre><br>result1 = M(<em>Exp1</em>, <em>Exp2</em>);<br></pre>
<br>
<p><br>must have the argument expressions <em>Exp1</em> and <em>Exp2</em><br>evaluated one after the other.<br>This is because in languages with side-effects,<br>evaluation of the argument <em>Exp1</em> may affect the value of <em>Exp2</em>.<br>However, in a functional language, the two expressions may be evaluated<br>concurrently because they are side-effect free.<br>On a multicore processor, that possibility exists.<br>Another benefit of a functional language is that if a second invocation<br>like this one</p>
<br>
<pre><br>result2 = M(<em>Exp1</em>, <em>Exp2</em>);<br></pre>
<br>
<p><br>is executed, the call to <em>M</em> can be suppressed because<br>the second call must yield the same result as the first one.<br>(The call to <em>M</em> is side-effect free.)<br>A good implementation of the language would cache the result of<br>the first call and save it for later use.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>As the numbers of processor cores increase, a new approach to<br>programming is needed to take proper advantage of that potential for<br>increased processing power.<br>Functional programming languages are seen as being a possible answer.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>F# as a Practical Functional Language</h2>
<br><br>
<p><br>Although the functional paradigm is prominent in F#, there is<br>also strong support for the imperative paradigm (in the form<br>of mutable datatypes), and for the object-oriented paradigm<br>(in that classes can be defined and instantiated).<br>These extra features have been added for efficiency and for<br>interoperability with the .NET class library.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>If a program is maintaining a large data structure, such as<br>an array, it is much more efficient to update an element of<br>that array in place than it is to make a new copy of the<br>array but with a different value for that one element.<br>Making a copy would be the pure functional approach to handling<br>the update.<br>Although an advocate for pure functional programming would<br>argue that an array is an inappropriate data structure (perhaps<br>one should use a list or a tree instead), an array is a<br>memory-efficient data structure which is widely used in software.<br>Providing arrays and allowing them to be mutable is a pragmatic<br>choice for F#.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>The inclusion of classes and object-orientation in general in F#<br>is another pragmatic choice.<br>Classes support inheritance and those provide a flexible form<br>of software reuse, and that is already a strong reason to<br>support them in F#.<br>Another reason is that a major software library, the .NET framework,<br>is usable from within F# programs only if class instances (objects)<br>can be created and used.<br>Access to the .NET framework allows production quality software<br>with rich user interfaces to be developed entirely in F#.</p>
<br><br>
<p><br>The F# tutorial accessible through this Try F# website should<br>get you started with F# programming and help you discover<br>whether it is a language you would want to use.<br>We hope it is.</p>
